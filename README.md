# Capital Markets SQL Database
An application created for COMM304 that models that capital markets in an SQL database.
The main purpose of this project was to apply concepts we had learned in class: creating an Oracle SQL database, populating the database, implementing insert/modify/delete functionality, and testing complex queries learned in class.
